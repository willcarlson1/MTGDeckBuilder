# Online Python Runner

This repository includes a simple static page that lets you run Python code directly in your web browser using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/).

## Quick Start

1. Open `online-python/index.html` in your browser.
2. Type Python code into the text area.
3. Click **Run** to see the output below the button.

No additional downloads are required because Pyodide is loaded from a CDN.

## Optional Hosting with GitHub Pages

To make the demo accessible from a public URL:

1. Create a new branch called `gh-pages` containing only the `online-python` directory.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings, selecting the `gh-pages` branch.
3. Visit `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/online-python/` to access the page.
